## Instructions

The goal of the game is to get across the board to the water without colliding with the bugs. The player controls the character by using the arrow keys on the keyboard. The player can move left, right, up, or down but cannot move off the board.

There are 3 enemy bugs that the player has to avoid in order to win. These bugs will only move left to right and always stay on the 3 rows of stone path. Once they get to the end, the bugs then loop back around in a random position going a random speed.

If they character does collide with a bug, the player will be notified that they are 'Starting Over...' and be sent back to the start position.

If the character gets all the to the water, a window will display where they can choose to play again.
